But when he tried to sell some BTC on Mt. Gox, he discovered that what was the world's largest platform at the time was difficult for beginners to use. As the adoption of blockchain continued, Michael and Eric realized that it was reshaping the financial system into one that would not only serve richest few, but everyone in the world \u2014 even the less educated, unemployed, and unbanked.

What we finally obtain is a multi-layered Merkle tree. Due to the characteristics of the hash function, once the Merkle root hash is determined, the hash of each leaf node is also determined. If any of the nodes are altered in any way, a change to the Merkle root hash would result.

Tether uses smart futures to issue, hold and transfer USDT on the TRON blockchain. From April 30th to August 7th, TRON has organized and prepared a bonus return (paid by USDT-TRON) activity with high rate of annualized returns to encourage users to convert USDT-OMNI into USDT-TRON. The activity will last until the early August. During the activity period, the USDT-TRON holders will get airdrop as bonus returns and the highest annualized rate of the return is up to 20%. KuCoin will offer full support to this activity and users transferring USDT into this activity will get the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT amount. KuCoin will convert the USDT-OMNI and USDT-ERC20 into USDT-TRON and the TRON will release the bonus rewards as airdrops to users through KuCoin. <br/><br/>(1) In this activity, you could transfer in/out your USDT at your convenience. <br/><br/>(2) At 24:00(UTC+8) each day, KuCoin will take a snapshot of the USDT-TRON amount hold by users and calculate the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT-TRON amount and the return rate of the day. <br/><br/>(3) The calculation of the return by 24:00(UTC+8) each day is based on the amount of USDT users transferred in before 16:00(UTC+8) that day. <br/><br/>(4) From 16:00(UTC+8) to 24:00(UTC+8) each day, if your total USDT-TRON amount increases, the increased part will be used for the return calculation of the next day at 24:00(UTC+8) and will not be used for the bonus return calculation of the day. Therefore, we suggest you transfer in USDT before 16:00(UTC+8) each day to get more bonus returns. <br/><br/>(5)Your bonus returns will be transferred into this activity directly.
